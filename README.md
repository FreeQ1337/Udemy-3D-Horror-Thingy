# Udemy-3D-Horror-Thingy


 This is my first project, nearly all scripts are written by me(except for the character controller, which is from the asset store tho). 
 Udemy course loosely followed, mainly in using the Unity editor aspects, as theres too much "ifology" used which is a very bad practice I assume.
